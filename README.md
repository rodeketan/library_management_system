# Library Management System

It is based on django and python. A user can login as a student or as an admin. A student can view details about books which are issued to him. An admin can issue a book to a student, view details about issued books, add books to library, view information of students, etc. When a superuser is logged in an admin, he has an additional feature of creating accounts for admin.
